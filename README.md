## Running Database locally

```shell
docker compose up
```
- After running the command, go to pgadmin which hosted in 
localhost:5050
- Database is hosted in localhost:5444
- If you have PgAdmin, you also can use your PgAdmin in local
instead of using localhost:5444 (Also, remove it from docker-composite.yaml if you don't want web version pgadmin to run)
