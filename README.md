## Running Database locally

```shell
docker compose up
```
- After running the command, go to pgadmin which hosted in 
localhost:5050
- Database is hosted in localhost:5444
- If you have pgadmin, you also can use your pgadmin in local
instead of using localhost:5444 (Also, can remove it from docker-composite.yaml)
